# Pi Network Integration Guide

## Prerequisites
- Application must run in Pi Browser
- Pi SDK is only available within Pi Browser
- No npm package needed - SDK is injected by Pi Browser

## Authentication Flow
1. Check if running in Pi Browser
   ```javascript
   const isPiBrowser = typeof window !== 'undefined' && 'Pi' in window;
   ```

2. Basic Authentication
   ```javascript
   const auth = await window.Pi.authenticate(['payments']);
   ```

## Required Features

### 1. User Authentication
- Authenticate user with Pi Network
- Store authentication state
- Handle authentication errors

### 2. Payments
- Create payment requests
- Handle incomplete payments
- Verify payments with backend

### 3. Implementation Phases

Phase 1: Basic Setup
- Remove current secret phrase functionality
- Add Pi Browser detection
- Add basic authentication

Phase 2: Payments
- Implement payment creation
- Add payment verification
- Handle callbacks

Phase 3: Error Handling
- Add proper error messages
- Implement fallbacks
- Add retry mechanisms

## Security Considerations
- Never store sensitive data in localStorage
- Always verify payments on backend
- Handle session expiration

## Testing
- Must test in Pi Browser
- Use Testnet for development
- Test both success and failure scenarios
